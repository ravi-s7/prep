The existing body of research highlights the transformative potential of blockchain and AI in education. Early work by Grech and Camilleri [2] demonstrated how distributed ledgers can secure academic credentials through immutable records, reducing the risk of forgery and streamlining verification processes. Building on this, Zyskind et al. [3] proposed a decentralized identity framework that empowers users to control their own personal data, ensuring privacy and auditability via smart contracts. In the realm of interview preparation, Jain et al. [4] developed an automated mock‑interview system integrating automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) to deliver scalable, personalized feedback. Complementarily, Hamari et al.’s systematic review of gamification [5] underscored how token‑based incentives can boost learner engagement, while Hinton et al. [6] laid the groundwork for robust voice interfaces by advancing deep neural network acoustic models for speech recognition.

Further, Siemens [7] outlined the core methodologies of learning analytics, advocating for data‑driven personalization and early risk detection. Chen et al. [8] investigated token economies within online learning environments, detailing how blockchain‑based rewards can motivate sustained participation yet cautioning about design and governance complexities. Finally, Alammary et al. [9] examined smart contract deployments in educational settings, illustrating their capacity to automate certification workflows but noting legal and scalability challenges. Together, these studies form a comprehensive foundation for integrating secure credentialing, analytics‑driven insights, and AI‑powered coaching into next‑generation learning platforms.
