## I. Introduction

The digital transformation of career preparation has accelerated the need for interactive, personalized interview practice platforms. Traditional interview preparation methods often lack personalization, real-time feedback, and accessibility. PrepNex addresses these challenges by combining AI voice agents, natural language processing, and modern web technologies to create an immersive interview practice environment. The platform also features an experimental OmniLearn Nexus module that explores decentralized learning concepts, providing a glimpse into future educational possibilities.

The emergence of conversational AI and voice technologies has created unprecedented opportunities to simulate realistic interview scenarios. Current interview preparation platforms typically offer static content or limited interaction models. PrepNex responds to these limitations with a comprehensive platform that adapts questioning based on user responses while providing detailed feedback through voice interactions, creating a more natural and effective practice environment.

Global trends toward remote and hybrid work arrangements have further highlighted the importance of effective interview preparation tools. As job interviews increasingly take place through digital platforms, candidates require solutions that help them prepare for this specific context. PrepNex's implementation of voice-based interactions and real-time feedback addresses these emerging needs, helping users develop both technical knowledge and communication skills critical for modern interviewing.

## II. Literature Survey

The existing body of research highlights the transformative potential of blockchain and AI in education. Early work by Grech and Camilleri [1] demonstrated how distributed ledgers can secure academic credentials through immutable records, reducing the risk of forgery and streamlining verification processes. Building on this, Zyskind et al. [2] proposed a decentralized identity framework that empowers users to control their own personal data, ensuring privacy and auditability via smart contracts. In the realm of interview preparation, Jain et al. [3] developed an automated mock‑interview system integrating automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) to deliver scalable, personalized feedback. Complementarily, Hamari et al.'s systematic review of gamification [4] underscored how token‑based incentives can boost learner engagement, while Hinton et al. [5] laid the groundwork for robust voice interfaces by advancing deep neural network acoustic models for speech recognition.

Further, Siemens [6] outlined the core methodologies of learning analytics, advocating for data‑driven personalization and early risk detection. Chen et al. [7] investigated token economies within online learning environments, detailing how blockchain‑based rewards can motivate sustained participation yet cautioning about design and governance complexities. Finally, Alammary et al. [8] examined smart contract deployments in educational settings, illustrating their capacity to automate certification workflows but noting legal and scalability challenges. Together, these studies form a comprehensive foundation for integrating secure credentialing, analytics‑driven insights, and AI‑powered coaching into next‑generation learning platforms.

Recent advances in federated learning architectures have created new possibilities for privacy-preserving AI systems in education. These approaches allow personalization without centralizing sensitive learner data, addressing a key concern in EdTech adoption. Notable implementations by McMahan and Ramage [9] demonstrated how models can be trained collaboratively across distributed devices while keeping personal data local. This paradigm directly informs PrepNex's approach to developing adaptive tutoring systems that respect user privacy while continuously improving through collective intelligence.

The intersection of immersive technologies with educational credentialing represents another promising frontier. Research by Johnson and Adams [10] examined how spatial computing enhances skill acquisition through embodied learning experiences, while Dede [11] proposed frameworks for assessing competencies demonstrated in virtual environments. These studies highlight how extended reality technologies can capture evidence of applied skills that traditional assessments often miss, providing a richer basis for credential validation and skills representation within platforms like PrepNex.
