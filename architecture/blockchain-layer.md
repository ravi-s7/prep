# Blockchain Layer Architecture

## Core Blockchain Infrastructure

### Primary Chain: Internet Computer (ICP)
- **Purpose**: Host on-chain AI models, smart contracts, and high-performance dApps
- **Benefits**: 
  - Sub-second finality
  - Web-speed transactions
  - Native HTTP requests
  - On-chain AI capabilities
  - Canister smart contracts for complex logic

### Secondary Chains
- **Mina Protocol**
  - Purpose: Lightweight zero-knowledge proofs for credential verification
  - Benefits: Constant-size blockchain (22kb) regardless of transaction volume
  
- **Polygon zkEVM**
  - Purpose: Scalable credential issuance and marketplace
  - Benefits: EVM compatibility, low gas fees, high throughput

### Cross-Chain Interoperability
- **Axelar Network**: For cross-chain credential verification
- **LayerZero**: For omnichain messaging between learning environments
- **Hyperlane**: For modular interoperability with future chains

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Credential Contracts (Polygon)
- **LivingCredentialFactory.sol**: ERC-6551 factory for creating token-bound accounts
- **CredentialRegistry.sol**: On-chain registry of all issued credentials
- **SkillVerifier.sol**: Oracle integration for real-time skill verification
- **CredentialTimelock.sol**: Time-based credential expiration and renewal

### Governance Contracts (ICP)
- **NexusDAO.sol**: Multi-tiered governance system
- **ProposalEngine.sol**: Proposal creation and voting mechanisms
- **TreasuryManagement.sol**: DAO treasury and fund allocation

### Tokenomics Contracts (ICP & Polygon)
- **KnowToken.sol**: ERC-20 utility token implementation
- **StakingPool.sol**: Staking mechanisms for governance and rewards
- **RevenueDistribution.sol**: Fee collection and distribution system

## Zero-Knowledge Infrastructure

### zk-STARKs Implementation
- **CredentialProver.sol**: Generate proofs of credential ownership
- **AnonymousVerification.sol**: Verify credentials without revealing identity
- **QuantumResistantSigning.sol**: Future-proof signature schemes

### Privacy Layer
- **PrivateCredentialVault.sol**: Encrypted storage of sensitive credential data
- **SelectiveDisclosure.sol**: Allow users to reveal specific aspects of credentials
- **ZKAttestations.sol**: Zero-knowledge attestations for skill verification

## Oracle Integration

### External Data Sources
- **GitHub Oracle**: Track code contributions and repository activity
- **Chainlink Automation**: Trigger credential updates based on real-world events
- **UMA Optimistic Oracle**: Dispute resolution for credential verification

### AI Oracle Network
- **SkillAssessmentOracle**: AI-powered assessment of user skills
- **ReputationOracle**: Track and verify user reputation across platforms
- **MarketTrendOracle**: Monitor emerging skill demands and market trends
